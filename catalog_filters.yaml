# Catalog Filters for Dynamic Model Catalog Selection (§4.5.4)
#
# Operator-level overrides for the model catalog. Even with the full
# catalog open, operators need controls for provider reliability,
# privacy concerns, terms of service, or cost controls.

version: 1

# Models or providers NEVER to use, regardless of profile match
blocklist:
  providers: []          # e.g. ["some-provider"] blocks all their models
  models: []             # e.g. ["openrouter/x/sketchy-model"]

# If non-empty, ONLY these providers are eligible (overrides blocklist)
# Leave empty to allow all providers
allowlist:
  providers:
    - "openrouter"
    - "huggingface"
  # models: []           # Leave empty to allow all models from allowed providers

# Hard cost ceiling — no request ever routes to a model above this price
# regardless of profile configuration. Safety valve against bugs in
# profile resolution accidentally routing a simple "what time is it?"
# to a $60/1M token model.

  max_cost_per_1m_input_tokens: 20.00
  max_cost_per_1m_output_tokens: 60.00
